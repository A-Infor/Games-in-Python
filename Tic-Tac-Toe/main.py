# ◼️ Game Rules

# Let's talk a little bit about the rules of Tic-Tac-Toe:

#     In Tic-Tac-Toe, two players try to fill a row,  a column, the diagonal, or the antidiagonal of a 3x3 game board.

# This will be our game board.

#     | 1 | 2 | 3 |
#     | 4 | 5 | 6 |
#     | 7 | 8 | 9 |

#     The user will enter an integer from 1 to 9 (inclusive) to select the position on the board.

#     On each turn, each player will select a particular position on the board and a marker will be added to that position.

#     A human player will play against a computer player, which will select a random position.

#     If the player selected a position that is already taken, he/she loses the turn.

#     When a row,  a column, the diagonal, or the antidiagonal is full with the player's markers, the game is over and that player wins the game.

#     If the board is full but none of the players has won the game, then there is a tie.

#     When the game is over, we will ask the user if he/she would like to continue playing. We will take user input and start a new round if the player chooses to continue the game.
