# ◼️ The Suit Class

#     The instances of this class shall have two instance attributes: description and symbol.

#     description can be either: "clubs", "diamonds", "hearts", or "spades".

#     symbol can be either: ♣, ♦, ♥, or ♠.

#     The instance attributes shall be read-only attributes (they should only have getters).

#     The class shall have a class attribute that maps suit descriptions to their corresponding symbols (this should be a dictionary).
