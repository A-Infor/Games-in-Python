# ◼️ The Card Class

#     The instances of this class shall have two instance attributes: suit and value.

#     suit must be an instance of the Suit class.

#     The instance attributes shall be read-only attributes (they should only have getters).

#     The class shall have a class attribute that maps the values of the special cards to their written descriptions (11 to "Jack", 12 to "Queen", 13 to "King", and 14 to "Ace"). This should be a dictionary.

#     The class shall have two methods: show and is_special.

#     The show method shall display the value, suit, and symbol of the suit of the card. If the card is special, this should be the written description (e.g. "Jack") instead of the value.

#     The is_special method shall return True if the value of the card is greater than or equal to 11 and False otherwise.
