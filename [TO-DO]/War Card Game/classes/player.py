# ◼️ The Player Class

#     The instances of this class shall have three instance attributes: name, deck, and is_computer.

#     name shall be a string.

#     deck shall be an instance of the Deck class.

#     is_computer shall be either True or False.

#     name shall be a public attribute and deck and is_computer shall be non-public read-only attributes.

#     The class shall have four methods: has_empty_deck, draw_card, and add_card.

#     The has_empty_deck method shall return True if the size of the player's deck is 0. Else, it shall return False.

#     The draw_card method shall draw a card from the player's deck if the deck is not empty and return it.

#     The add_card method shall add a card to the bottom of the player's deck.
